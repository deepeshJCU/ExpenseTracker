# Expense Tracker App

This repository contains the initial development stage of my Expense Tracker App built using Android with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Current Development Status

- **Home Screen Mockup**: Designed using various Jetpack Compose components such as Column, Row, Box, and ConstraintLayout.
- **Images**: Uploaded several assets to the drawable folder and integrated them within composable `Image` components.
- **UI Debugging**: Applied borders to composables to visually debug and verify layout rendering.
- **Dependencies**: Imported and set up ConstraintLayout for enhanced UI layout control.

## Tech Stack

- Android (Kotlin)
- Jetpack Compose
- ConstraintLayout

## Next Steps

- Implement full functionality for transaction management (CRUD operations).
- Set up Room database integration for persistent data storage.
- Add more interactive UI components and data visualizations.
